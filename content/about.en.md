The images on this website are digital reproductions of original gelatin silver 12x16in (30.5x40.6cm) prints made by the artist. Most prints were made between 2018 and 2020, although some were printed circa 1990. The older prints are unique because of the quality of the emulsions which were then available. Unfortunately emulsions with that quality are no longer produced.
